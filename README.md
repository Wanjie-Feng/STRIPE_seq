# About
This repository contains the key files and key analysis processes required for the stripe seq process for soybeans

# Instructions
- The 01soybean_script.sh script covers the main steps from the fastq file to the downstream analysis.
- The 02New_TSS_redup.ipynb file is actually a series of R commands for the downstream analysis process.

You can arrange your data according to the directory structure in the warehouse for repeatable analysis.


**Note**: Because the original sequencing data and genome files are too large, we have not saved them here. If necessary, the corresponding genome files can be downloaded from the Phytozome data.
