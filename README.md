# About
This repository contains the key files and analysis processes required for the stripe seq process for soybeans

# Instructions
- The 01Preprocessing_and_mapping.sh script covers the main steps from the fastq file to the downstream analysis.
- The 02CAGEfightR_for_downstream_analysis.ipynb file is actually a series of R commands for the downstream analysis process.

You can arrange your data according to the directory structure in the warehouse for repeatable analysis.


**Note**: Because the original sequencing data and genome files are too large, we have not saved them here. If necessary, the corresponding genome files can be downloaded from the Phytozome database [here](https://data.jgi.doe.gov/refine-download/phytozome?genome_id=275&_gl=1*6u2d8s*_ga*MTAwMTIzMDYyLjE3MTY5NzE1MTI.*_ga_YBLMHYR3C2*MTcxNzIzOTgxNS4xMC4wLjE3MTcyMzk4MTUuMC4wLjA.).
